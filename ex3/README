==================
=  Description:  =
==================

= findLargest:

Program the retrieve number of riders from users and returns
the position of the rider wearing the tallest hat and his hat 
size.

= findSecondSmallest:

Program that for each of 10 dancers, it asks the user for his
age. At the end it prints the position of the 2nd youngest dancer.

= totalWeight:

Calculating pack weight of Sam and Frodo. Running a loop that 
asks input from user. If one of the restriction (overweight etc) 
is violated then the program acts accordingly (alert, end program).
The loop runs until the ring's weight is entered as input

= twoDimensional:

Logging the turns and steps of Sam and Frodo on their way to their
destiny. Eventually the program will evaluate Gandalf way to the
same destiny as he can fly directly, almost without turns.

= ithElementValue:

An implementation of Fibbonaci sequence calculation for any 
input. 
The program gets an integer from user which will be orc_number, 
it then computes how many arrows are needed for Legolas to kill
all those orcs.

= decomposition:

Getting a positive integer from user, where each digit in the number
represent a different quantity of goblets drank by gimli at a 
single day. Each digit's position represent the day of drinking that
quantity.
In the first loop the program seperates the input number to digits
stored in list. 
The second loop, iterates through the genereated list and prints
the number of goblets drank during each day.

= binaryToDecimal:

Given a binary number , the program calculates its decimal (base 10)
representation form and prints it.

= decimalToBinary:

Given a decimal binary (base 10) the program calculates the
number's binary representation.


=============================
=   Answer to question 9    =
=============================
1. The main difference between two implementation is that in 
decimalToBinary I used modulus operation and division over 2 as in 
binary to decimal we use power of 2's (digit_i * 2^n). 

2. in decimalToBinary to it is enough to just change the base from 2 to 10
and the multiplication of i to 2 and therefor it solves both question.

3. Similar to the previous answer approach, you could easily use the 
decimalToBinary implementation to compute any base transitions.
However, the transition should be in 2 stages. First base_source should
be converted to decimal number, then that decimal number should be converted
to the target_base number.
Conversion might work without the decimal "stage" in the middle, but for
bases that don't share mutual power (for example:2, 4, 8) the middle stage
is crucial.

Add an input variable for base source and target and change the formulas
accordingly.
