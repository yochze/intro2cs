=  Question  2.5.D  =
=====================
The assignment was to create a searching algorithm on a list in a complexity
no bigger the n.
To achieve this assignment I implemented a quicksort algorithm to sort a copy
of the list (a new parameter in the class).
Then, when having the sorted list, I could use the binary search algorithm
to easily and fastly lookup a word/term in my duplicated sorted list.
