Readme for the 8th exercise in Intro2CS.

Usage:
python3 asteroidsMain.py
 
==================
=  Description:  =
==================
The program is an OOP implementation of Asteroids game.
It uses external graphic interface provided by TKinter and Turtle.

In the exercise I implemented large portion of the GameRunner(asteroidsMain.py)
class. Including movement of objects, shooting torpedos, gaining scores, etc.

Exiting game occures when the end-user presses "q" key or loses all of his 
lives, or winning and destroying all asteroids.
