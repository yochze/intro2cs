Readme for the sixth exercise in Intro2CS.
An implementation of several recursion functions.

Usage:
python3 palindrome.py
python3 balanced_brackets.py
python3 y_tree.py # Default is set to 200.


==================
=  Description:  =
==================

Palindrome:

wo recursive functions to determine whether a string is palindrome
or not.
The first gets a full string and returns boolean according to the 
string palindromically.
The second program gets a string and two indexes representing a 
substring in the original string. Then it tests if the substring
is palindrome or not. return a boolean accordingly.


Balanced Brackets:

Several functions to determine if a string has a balanced
structure of parenthesis.
Also functions to determine what is wrong in an unbalanced
string. And another function to map the parenthesis and chars
in a balanced string.


YTree:

A recursive function that uses the turtle external library to
draw a binary tree in the size of the user input (or default: 200).
