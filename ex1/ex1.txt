## Part 1

1. help(turtle.goto)
   
   Typing this command in the Python3 interpreter returns a full description of the goto function in the imported turtle library.
   It contains the possible input arguments or that function, a text description of what the function is doing.
   And finally several examples.


2. turtle.goto

   Typing this will return the address of the function object is stored at. It is not calling the function itself (because we omitted the '()')	

3. turtle.goto(100,100)

   Typing this will trigger the turtle#goto function and run it. It will open the turtle window and will go to x=100, y=100 from x=0, y=0.
