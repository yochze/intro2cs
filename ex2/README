Readme for the second exercise in Intro2CS.
2 Programs that do simple mathematical calculations.

Usage:
python3 ex2a.py
python3 ex2b.py

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

ex2b:
The first program (ex1a.py) can calculate geometric shapes' perimeter and area.
The initial input from user is 1 to 3 integers that each of them represent a 
shape (1. rectangle, 2. circle, 3. triangle).
Then, the program run a area/perimeter formula for each shape,
based on the chosen shape.

ex2b
The second program, is a simple calculator.
It handles 2 integers for input and ask for an operation command from 
user (+, -, *, / or %)
For each operation it calculates the answer. The system also handles 
exceptions like division by 0.
