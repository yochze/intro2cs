Morphing

Face morphing program
The program gets 2 images of faces, and several parameters and form
a new combined image of both of the faces.

Part A:

This part includs the points gathering from the end-user.
Then, the program creates triangles based on the given points while
validating based on a few rules.

Then, based on the list of triangles of each image (two lists), the
program computes (with an alpha param) a new list of intermediate triangles
and generates a new list of the intermediate triangles.

Part B:


TBD
